        <h1>When is 2FA day?</h1>
		<p>World 2FA Day is celebrated annually on February 2nd. The chosen date, also known as 2nd FActor Day, was chosen because it contains the abbreviation "2FA" in the date (<span class="underline">2</span>nd of <span class="underline">F</span>ebru<span class="underline">A</span>ry). 
		It is celebrated following "<a class="linkhover" href="https://www.checkiday.com/e1175a8cc610318c9af8a0daafbe79a6/change-your-password-day">Change your 1FA day</a>" on February 1st. So next time if someone asks you, what day is the 2nd of February, you answer with" 2FA Day"!</br>
If you want a reminder of 2FA Day every year, please download the <a class="linkhover" href="2FA-Day.ics">iCalendar file</a> and import it into your calender.</p>
		The first annual 2FA Day was observed on February 2nd, 2022.</p>
</div>
      <div class="text-box" id="what">
        <h1>What is 2FA?</h1>
		<p>2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts, in addition to your password. Two-Factor Authentication is a form of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
		By requiring not just a password, but also something you have, such as a phone or security key, 2FA helps to prevent unauthorized access to your personal and financial information.</br>
		Implementing 2FA can greatly enhance the security of your online accounts and protect against identity theft. 
        Additional information regarding Two-Factor Authentication can be found on <a class="linkhover" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-box" id="purpose">
        <h1>What is the purpose of 2FA Day?</h1>
		<p>The purpose of 2FA Day is to educate people about the benefits of using 2FA, and encourage them to enable it on their online accounts. By using 2FA, individuals and organizations can greatly reduce the risk of their accounts being compromised by hackers and cybercriminals.</p>
		<p>By promoting the use of 2FA, organizations and individuals can work together to improve the overall security of the internet and protect personal information from being stolen or misused.</br>
Ultimately, the goal of 2FA Day is to make the use of two-factor authentication so widespread that the need for a dedicated 2FA Day is no longer necessary.
</p>
		</div>
      <div class="text-box" id="help">
        <h1>Can I help?</h1>
		<p>There are a few things you can do to help promote the use of 2FA among people and organizations. One way is to simply spread the word about the benefits of 2FA to your friends, family, and colleagues. You can tell them how 2FA can help protect their personal information and online accounts from being compromised by cybercriminals.</p><p>
		Another way you can help is by encouraging organizations that you are a customer or member of to implement 2FA on their accounts and systems. This can include reaching out to the organization directly and expressing your interest in them implementing 2FA, or sharing information and resources about 2FA with them. For example, you can <a class="linkhover" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Calling%20all%20Spotify%20users!%20Two-factor%20authentication%20is%20a%20must-have%20for%20online%20security.%20Let's%20ask%20%40Spotify%20to%20make%20it%20an%20option%20for%20everyone,%20not%20just%20artists.%20Share%20if%20you%20agree!%20%232FA%20%23MFA%20%23Spotify%20%23OnlineSecurity%20%232FAday%20https://2fa.day" alt="Share the tweet on Twitter" title="Ask Spotify to take responsibility for adding 2FA">ask Spotify to add 2FA by sharing this tweet</a>.</p><p>
		You can also use your social media and other platforms to share information and resources about 2FA, and encourage others to enable it on their accounts. This can include sharing articles, blog posts, or videos about 2FA and its benefits, as well as sharing personal experiences with 2FA.
